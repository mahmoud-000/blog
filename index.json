We saw how data is saved in multiple different ways within the database using the One-To-Many relationship in Laravel. But how to fetch data from the database? There are several ways in which data can be fetched from a database. These methods are divided into two basic methods:\nThrough the user User Model # This method is divided into two sub-methods depending on how the data is organized after it is fetched from the data base\nWithout using API Resources. # We go first to the routes/web.php file so that we can test these methods and make the following modifications. use App\\Models\\User; --- Route::get(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;, function () { $users = User::with([\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;posts\u0026#39;])-\u0026gt;get(); return view(\u0026#39;users.list\u0026#39;, compact(\u0026#39;users\u0026#39;)); }); Here we can choose the columns for each relationship as follows.\nuse App\\Models\\User; --- Route::get(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;, function () { $users = User::with([\u0026#39;profile:id,firstname,lastname,user_id\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;posts:title,user_id\u0026#39;])-\u0026gt;get(); return view(\u0026#39;users.list\u0026#39;, compact(\u0026#39;users\u0026#39;)); }); In order to know the difference between selecting or not selecting columns from the database, let us see the specific response to each case.\nIn the first case, with all data retrieved without exception, we find that $users contains that data.

We have seen how data is saved in several different ways in the database using the one-to-one relationship in Laravel. But how do we retrieve the data from the database? There are several ways to retrieve data from the database.\nThese methods can be divided into two main categories:\nDirect retrieval: This method involves directly querying the database for the data that you need. This is the most efficient way to retrieve data, but it can be difficult to use if you are not familiar with SQL.\nEloquent ORM: Laravel\u0026rsquo;s Eloquent ORM provides a more user-friendly way to retrieve data from the database. Eloquent ORM uses a set of methods to map database tables to objects in PHP. This makes it easy to retrieve data from the database without having to know SQL. In this tutorial, we will focus on using Eloquent ORM to retrieve data from the database.\nWhile retrieving users data: # While collecting user data, we will obtain their personal profiles. After that, the matter of displaying that data is divided into two forms, not a third. The type of application you are working on and the theme used will determine which form to use.\nFirst: an application that uses web routes. Second: an application that depends on API routes.

The matter increases significantly if the data is much larger than that.\nWhen choosing specific columns from relationships, you must always choose the foreign key column. Without choosing it, the data will not be returned correctly from the database.\nInside the views folder, we add another folder named users. Inside the users folder, we add the file list.blade.php. In list.blade.php, we add this simple table to display the users: \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;thead\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th style=\u0026#34;text-align: center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Username\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th style=\u0026#34;text-align: center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Firstname\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th style=\u0026#34;text-align: center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Lastname\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/thead\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tbody\u0026gt; @foreach ($users as $user) \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;{{ $user-\u0026gt;username }}\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;{{ $user-\u0026gt;profile-\u0026gt;firstname }}\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;{{ $user-\u0026gt;profile-\u0026gt;lastname }}\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; @endforeach \u0026lt;/tbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; Open your browser and go to the following URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/users to see what results will appear. Users Table Second: Depends on Api Routes. # What are API Resources?\nSimply, it is an intermediate layer between Eloquent and the API response, converting data obtained from the database into JSON with the ability to specify specific data without others or manipulate that data.\nWe will create an API Resource for users and profiles. Execute this command at the command prompt. php artisan make:resource UserResource php artisan make:resource ProfileResource Go to the following path: App\\Http\\Resources and edit both: The file ProfileResource.php. \u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Http\\Resources; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; use Illuminate\\Http\\Resources\\Json\\JsonResource; class ProfileResource extends JsonResource { public method toArray(Request $request): array { return [ \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;id, \u0026#39;firstname\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;firstname, \u0026#39;lastname\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;lastname, ]; } } The file UserResource.php. \u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Http\\Resources; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; use Illuminate\\Http\\Resources\\Json\\JsonResource; class UserResource extends JsonResource { public method toArray(Request $request): array { return [ \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;id, \u0026#39;username\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;username, \u0026#39;profile\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; ProfileResource::make($this-\u0026gt;whenLoaded(\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;)), ]; } } Go to your routes/api.php file and add a new route. use App\\Models\\User; use App\\Http\\Resources\\UserResource; --- Route::get(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;, method () { $users = User::with([\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;])-\u0026gt;get(); $usersResource = UserResource::collection($users); return response()-\u0026gt;json($usersResource); }); Open your browser and go to the following URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users to see what results will appear.

After that, the data can be displayed in two forms, not three.

The matter increases significantly if the data is much larger than that.\nWhen selecting specific columns in relationships, you must include the id field when choosing the user relationship. Otherwise, the user will not be returned with the profile.\nInside the views folder, we add another folder named profiles. Inside the profiles folder, we add the file list.blade.php. In list.blade.php, we add this simple table to display the profiles: \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;thead\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th style=\u0026#34;text-align: center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Username\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th style=\u0026#34;text-align: center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Firstname\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th style=\u0026#34;text-align: center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Lastname\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/thead\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tbody\u0026gt; @foreach ($profiles as $profile) \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;{{ $profile-\u0026gt;user-\u0026gt;username }}\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;{{ $profile-\u0026gt;firstname }}\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;{{ $profile-\u0026gt;lastname }}\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; @endforeach \u0026lt;/tbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; Open your browser and go to the following URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/profiles to see what results will appear.

When dealing with a large database with a lot of data, it is important to consider performance. This means not only how long it takes to get the data, but also how many queries are executed per page.\nTo test the performance of your application, you can use a library called Laravel Debugbar. Debugbar will show you all the queries that are executed on each page, as well as how long each query takes to execute. This information can help you to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your application.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s run this command. composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev Make sure that APP_DEBUG=true is inside the .env file.\nThe difference between the two cases is as follows: $users = User::all(); $users = User::with(\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;get(); We open the browser and go to the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/users to see what results will appear in the library bar. (Lazy Loading) - Retrieve data without using with. laravel debugbar lazy loading At the bottom of the page, we will now find a bar for the Laravel Debugbar library. When you click on it, we will find that it works with a lot of data. The thing that interests us here is the number of SQL queries on this page, and as shown, they are 4 queries.\nAnd we only retrieved 3 users, imagine with me if there are tens of thousands or millions of users inside this database, the time to load this page will be very slow because of the huge number of queries.\nThis is called the N+1 problem in Laravel. It is caused by lazy loading relationships, which means that the associated data is not loaded until it is actually needed. In this case, we are lazy loading the posts relationship for each user. This means that we are making a separate query for each user to get their profiles.\nIf there are 1000 users, we will make 1001 queries: 1 query to get the users, and 1000 queries to get their profiles. This is a waste of server resources and can make your application slow.\nTo solve the N+1 problem, you can eager load the relationships. This means that you will load the associated data when you first retrieve the data. In this case, you would use the with() method to eager load the profiles relationship. This would only make one query to get the users and their profiles.\nEager loading can improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of queries. It is a good practice to eager load relationships whenever possible.\n(Eager Loading) - Retrieve data using with. laravel debugbar eager loading As you can see, by adding the with() method with the name of the relationship, each user\u0026rsquo;s data will be fetched with their own profile without the N+1 problem.\nSo the number of queries was reduced from 4 to 2 only. This will clearly have an effect if this database is of medium size or large. This is what is called eager loading.\nYou can find the repo of this series on github here: ","date":"13 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/how-can-you-retrieve-data-from-a-one-to-one-relationship-in-laravel/","section":"Blogs","summary":"How can you retrieve data from a one-to-one relationship in Laravel?","title":"How can you retrieve data from a one-to-one relationship in Laravel?","type":"blog"},{"content":" How to insert data in one to one relationship in database? After we created a one-to-one relationship between the users table and the profiles table, and added the hasOne() method to the User model, and the belongsTo() method to the Profile model, it\u0026rsquo;s time to find out how the data is saved in the database when we use this relationship. And what are the methods used for that?\nThese methods are divided into three main ways:\nWithout using method profile. By using method profile. By using the inverse method user. The best method to use depends on the specific needs of your application. If you only need to save the profile associated with the user, then the first method is the simplest option. If you need to get, update, or delete the profile, then the second method is a better option. If you need to get, update, or delete the user, then the third method is a better option.\n1.

They join two tables such that one row in the first table is associated with only one row in the other table, or the same table.\nlaravel one to one relationship To see this in action, we\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating a content management system.\nTo see this in action, let\u0026rsquo;s start by creating a content management system. Let\u0026rsquo;s say each user has their own single profile. In some cases, you can store all profile information in the Users table. However, this is not ideal.\nIn our example, we want to create a separate table for personal profiles. This will allow us to transfer a profile from one user to another easily if we need to.\nBy default, the Users table exists in Laravel. The columns that it contains do not matter for this example.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we have a users table with the following columns: Schema::create(\u0026#39;users\u0026#39;, method (Blueprint $table) { $table-\u0026gt;id(); $table-\u0026gt;string(\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;); $table-\u0026gt;string(\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;unique(); $table-\u0026gt;timestamps(); }); We edit the User.php file. protected $fillable = [\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;]; We create Profile Model with its table. php artisan make:model Profile -m In a one-to-one relationship, we have the freedom to choose one of these two methods to establish the relationship:\nAdd user_id in the profiles table. Add profile_id in the users table. Usually, the column that joins the two tables is added to the second table. So, we will add it to the profiles table as follows:\nSchema::create(\u0026#39;profiles\u0026#39;, method (Blueprint $table) { $table-\u0026gt;id(); $table-\u0026gt;string(\u0026#39;firstname\u0026#39;); $table-\u0026gt;string(\u0026#39;lastname\u0026#39;); $table-\u0026gt;string(\u0026#39;birthday\u0026#39;); $table-\u0026gt;foreignId(\u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;constrained(); $table-\u0026gt;timestamps(); }); We edit the Profile.php file. protected $fillable = [ \u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;firstname\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;lastname\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;birthday\u0026#39; ]; Let\u0026rsquo;s run this command to update the database. php artisan migrate Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the User.php file to define the relationship. public method profile() { return $this-\u0026gt;hasOne(Profile::class); } Let\u0026rsquo;s see how the hasOne() method works. This method is used to save the id of the related model in the foreign key column of the parent model.\n$this-\u0026gt;hasOne(Profile::class, \u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39; // foreignKey By Default Parent Model + Promary Key \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; // localKey =\u0026gt; Primary Key In Parent Table By Default is Id ); Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the Profile.php file to define the inverse relationship. public method user() { return $this-\u0026gt;belongsTo(User::class); } Let\u0026rsquo;s find out how the belongsTo() method works. This method is used to save the id of the parent model in the primary key column of the related model.\n$this-\u0026gt;belongsTo(User::class, \u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39; // foreignKey By Default Parent Model + Promary Key \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; // OwnerKey By Default Id ); Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to name the relationship something like admin, we need to add the foreignKey property to the relationship method.\npublic method admin() { return $this-\u0026gt;belongsTo(User::class, \u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39; // You must add foreignKey ); } The foreignKey property is used to specify the name of the column in the child model that is used to reference the parent model.\nIf you do not add the foreignKey property to the relationship method when changing the relationship name, you will see the following error: Attempt to read property X on null You can find the repo of this series on github here: ","date":"11 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/how-to-create-a-one-to-one-relationship-in-laravel/","section":"Blogs","summary":"How to create a One-To-One relationship in Laravel?","title":"How to create a One-To-One relationship in Laravel?","type":"blog"},{"content":"Often, developers need to interact with databases. If you are using the Laravel framework, you should know about one of its most important features: Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes this process simple and easy.\nLaravel Eloquent is one of the main features in the Laravel framework. This is due to its great support for defining, creating, and managing relationships between different tables. In this series of articles, I will show you how to create and use Eloquent relationships.\nIt is important to note that you can start using Eloquent without any prior knowledge of relationships.\nAs a professional programmer, it is necessary to understand the types of relationships. However, before that, you must ask yourself an important question: what are relationships in the first place?\nWhat are relationships in databases? # What are relationships in databases? When working with tables in a database that have relationships between them, we can describe these relationships as links between those tables. This helps you organize and structure data effortlessly, allowing for faster data reading and processing.\nWhat types of relationships are there in Laravel? # What types of relationships are there in Laravel? There are three main types of relationships in databases that are commonly used in practice:\none-to-one: A one-to-one relationship means that one record in one table can only be related to one record in another table. For example, a customer table might have a one-to-one relationship with an address table. This means that each customer can only have one address, and each address can only be associated with one customer.\none-to-many: A one-to-many relationship means that one record in one table can be related to many records in another table. For example, an order table might have a one-to-many relationship with a product table. This means that one order can have many products, but each product can only be associated with one order.\nmany-to-many: A many-to-many relationship means that many records in one table can be related to many records in another table. For example, a student table might have a many-to-many relationship with a course table. This means that many students can take many courses, and many courses can be taken by many students.\nBesides these relationships, Laravel offers more relationships, namely:\nHas Many Through: This relationship allows you to relate a model to another model through a third model. For example, a user model might have a has many through relationship with a post model, where the third model is a category model. This means that a user can have many posts, where each post belongs to a category.\nPolymorphic Relations: This relationship allows you to relate a model to multiple other models of different types. For example, a comment model might have a polymorphic relationship with a model, where the model could be a blog post, a product, or a user. This means that a comment can be associated with any of these three types of models.\nMany-to-many Polymorphic: This relationship is a combination of the has many through and polymorphic relationships. It allows you to relate a model to many other models of different types, where the relationship is mediated by a third model. For example, a user model might have a many-to-many polymorphic relationship with a model, where the third model is a role model. This means that a user can have many roles, where each role could be a user, a product, or a blog post.\nThe number of relationships that we will explain is 6 types. We will build a simple content management system to explain all of those relationships.\nDo I need specific knowledge of Eloquent before reading this?\nIn response to your question about whether you need specific knowledge of Eloquent before reading this, I would say that it is not strictly necessary, but it would be helpful. The examples in the article do not use any complex Eloquent methods or techniques, but it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of how Eloquent works before reading the article.\nIf you are new to Laravel, I would recommend reading the Laravel documentation: https://laravel.com/docs/ before reading this article. The documentation provides a good overview of Eloquent and how it works.\nOnce you have a basic understanding of Eloquent, you should be able to follow the examples in the article without any problems. However, if you get stuck, you can always refer to the documentation for more help.\nIn the examples below, I have tried to explain everything as clearly as possible, without using too many tricky Eloquent methods and complex techniques. This means that prior knowledge is not strictly necessary. However, it is always best to learn the basics first and then pursue more complex topics such as relationships.\n","date":"10 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/what-types-of-relationships-are-there-in-laravel/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Often, developers need to interact with databases.","title":"What types of relationships are there in Laravel?","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"1 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/full-stack/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Full Stack","type":"tags"},{"content":" Preview # Laravel 10 Vue 3 What is Laravel # Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details. What is Vue js! # Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It Helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex. What is Vite js! # Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:\nA dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).\nA build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
