### Delete data using User Model.
* We first go to the ***`routes/web.php`*** file and add this route:
```PHP
Route::get('/users/profile/delete', method () {
    $user = User::with('profile')->find(1);
    $user->profile()->delete();
    return response()->json($user);
});
```

* We open the browser and navigate to the new URL ***`http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/profile/delete`*** to find that the profile have been deleted successfully.
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "Joun Doe",
  "created_at": "2023-08-07T06:23:03.000000Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-08-10T05:07:38.000000Z",
  "profile": null
}
```
> Refresh the page twice to show that this user's profile has been deleted.
