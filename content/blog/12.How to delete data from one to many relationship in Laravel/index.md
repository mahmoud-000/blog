### Delete data using the user form.
* First go to ***`routes/web.php`*** file and add this route:
```PHP
Route::get('/users/posts/delete', function () {
    $user = User::with('posts')->find(1);
    $user->posts()->whereIn('id', [1, 2])->delete();
    return response()->json($user);
});
```

* We open the browser and go to the new URL ***`http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/posts/delete`*** to find that the post has been deleted successfully.
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "John Doe Updated",
  "created_at": "2023-09-06T17:24:02.000000Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-09-06T18:49:54.000000Z",
  "posts": [
    {
